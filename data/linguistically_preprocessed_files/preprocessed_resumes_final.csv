I also work closely with the electronic filing Tax Examiners in assisting the transmitters in problem solving their situation. Another responsibility I had was to have all of the data copied to a nine-track tape and processed on the mainframe computer from that output then we had to drain the information on to an archival system that allowed the authorized I.R.S employees to access the returns if a taxpayer had questions about their returns. I also helped my group to maintain our network and desktop computers. There were times we would lose connection to the network and we would have to use a network sniffer that would assist us on the type and location of the problem that needed to be fixed. I also would install updates to the workstations, as they became available to us thru download transmittal. Job Related Training:. Item Item Description Completion Date.
