      "Why Raw Resume Text Cannot Be Directly Vectorized:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. INCONSISTENT FORMATTING\n",
      "   - Resumes have varying layouts, headers, footers, line breaks\n",
      "   - Different fonts, symbols, and special characters\n",
      "   - Inconsistent spacing and whitespace\n",
      "\n",
      "2. NOISE AND IRRELEVANT TOKENS\n",
      "   - Numbers (phone, zip codes, years) add noise without semantic value\n",
      "   - Special symbols, punctuation, Unicode characters don't represent skills/experience\n",
      "   - Headers, section markers (e.g., \"EDUCATION:\", \"SKILLS:\") are structural, not content\n",
      "\n",
      "3. DIMENSIONALITY PROBLEMS\n",
      "   - Raw text creates extremely high-dimensional vectors\n",
      "   - Each unique token becomes a dimension (curse of dimensionality)\n",
      "   - Increases computational complexity and storage requirements\n",
      "   - Makes ML models harder to train and slower to predict\n",
      "\n",
      "4. REDUNDANCY\n",
      "   - Same concepts represented differently (run, running, runs)\n",
      "   - Stopwords (the, is, at) appear frequently but don't add meaning\n",
      "   - Proper nouns and variations create unnecessary dimensions\n",
      "\n",
      "5. SEMANTIC LOSS\n",
      "   - Raw tokens don't capture meaning\n",
      "   - \"engineer\", \"engineering\", \"engineers\" are treated as different tokens\n",

    "explanation_1 = \"\"\"\n",
    "Why Raw Resume Text Cannot Be Directly Vectorized:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. INCONSISTENT FORMATTING\n",
    "   - Resumes have varying layouts, headers, footers, line breaks\n",
    "   - Different fonts, symbols, and special characters\n",
    "   - Inconsistent spacing and whitespace\n",
    "\n",
    "2. NOISE AND IRRELEVANT TOKENS\n",
    "   - Numbers (phone, zip codes, years) add noise without semantic value\n",
    "   - Special symbols, punctuation, Unicode characters don't represent skills/experience\n",
    "   - Headers, section markers (e.g., \"EDUCATION:\", \"SKILLS:\") are structural, not content\n",
    "\n",
    "3. DIMENSIONALITY PROBLEMS\n",
    "   - Raw text creates extremely high-dimensional vectors\n",
    "   - Each unique token becomes a dimension (curse of dimensionality)\n",
    "   - Increases computational complexity and storage requirements\n",
    "   - Makes ML models harder to train and slower to predict\n",
    "\n",
    "4. REDUNDANCY\n",
    "   - Same concepts represented differently (run, running, runs)\n",
    "   - Stopwords (the, is, at) appear frequently but don't add meaning\n",
    "   - Proper nouns and variations create unnecessary dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "5. SEMANTIC LOSS\n",
    "   - Raw tokens don't capture meaning\n",
    "   - \"engineer\", \"engineering\", \"engineers\" are treated as different tokens\n",
    "   - Lack of context for text similarity calculations\n",
