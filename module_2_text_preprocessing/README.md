# Module 2: Text Preprocessing

**Assigned to: Person 2 & Person 3**

This module combines text cleaning, normalization, and linguistic preprocessing.

## Responsibilities

### Text Cleaning & Normalization
- Convert text to lowercase
- Remove punctuation, special characters, extra spaces
- Handle PDF noise (headers, broken lines, symbols)
- Remove irrelevant tokens (numbers, symbols where needed)
- Provide cleaned text output

### Linguistic Preprocessing
- Tokenization
- Stopword removal
- Lemmatization
- Decide preprocessing order
- Experiment with lemmatization vs no lemmatization
- Finalize preprocessing pipeline

## Must Be Able to Explain

- Why raw resume text cannot be directly vectorized
- Impact of noisy tokens on TF-IDF
- Stemming vs lemmatization
- Why preprocessing order matters

## Implementation Tasks

- [ ] Implement text cleaning functions
- [ ] Implement tokenization
- [ ] Implement stopword removal
- [ ] Implement lemmatization
- [ ] Experiment with preprocessing order
- [ ] Create unified preprocessing pipeline
- [ ] Document preprocessing decisions
